Support Vector Machine (SVM) & K-Means Clustering Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Means Clustering algorithms from scratch, without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. These implementations aim to deepen your understanding of supervised classification and unsupervised clustering techniques.

📌 Algorithms Implemented
1️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks.

Implements the Hard-Margin and/or Soft-Margin SVM (based on hinge loss).

Optimized using Gradient Descent or a basic Quadratic Programming approach.

2️⃣ K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering unlabeled data.

Implements iterative steps of Assignment and Update.

Includes methods to visualize cluster formation over iterations.

🚀 How to Use
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

Pandas

Sklearn (for comparison with our version)

Running the Code
Support Vector Machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
python svm.py
(You can modify datasets, kernel types, or hyperparameters.)

K-Means Clustering:

bash
Copy
Edit
python kmeans.py
(Feel free to change the number of clusters k and initialize different data.)

📊 Results
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Trains on a sample binary-class dataset.

Plots the decision boundary separating two classes.

Shows support vectors clearly.

K-Means Clustering
Clusters a set of data points into k distinct groups.

Visualizes the movement of cluster centroids over iterations.
